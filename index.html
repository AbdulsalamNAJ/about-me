    <div class="about-me">
        <p>My name is <strong>Abdulsalam Al-Najjar</strong> I  was born in Saudi Arabia and then moved with my family to Jordan, I likes PC <i class="fa fa-desktop" aria-hidden="true"></i> since I was kid, my bigger brother bought one when I was 12 years old, so I started to discover this incredible machine how it works and I learned how to use programs like paint, MS word and the movie maker.
        <br><br>My cousin told me about a program that can make Windows multimedia programs called "Multimedia builder" so I started to learn coding at that age but when I finished the high school and wanted to join a university in IT my scores did not qualify for that, so I chosed another field, after graduation from university my skills in designing was intermediate so I was a trianer in graphic design to improve my skills.
        <br><br>I worked in this field for three years making posters, business cards and roll-ups but I felt that I'm missing something so I started to learn programming again by my own, I bought courses on website called "Udemy" and started to learn the basis of HTML <i class="fa fa-html5" aria-hidden="true"></i> CSS <i class="fa fa-css3" aria-hidden="true"></i> and Javascript <strong>{JS}</strong> after three months I joined <strong>LTUC</strong> in thier Advanced programming course and hopefully it will help me to reach my future goals.</p>
